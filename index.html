        <p>They are incredibly cute, just make you want to drop your jaw in Awe at them. They can swing from tree to tree (with their hands, feet, and tail). Have you seen a baby monkey? IKR! Do you know about Marmoset Monkeys, AKA Finger Monkeys? People naturally want to "pet" them. They can also be dangerous too. Monkey won't let you down - they even have their own movies and songs too.</p>
